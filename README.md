# Intro

Hi friends, Wyn-Hangry is a midterm project created by four brilliant students including I(Wilson)! The application is live and deployed through Heroku. It allows its users to find restaurants closes to them. The user is able to filter based on cuisine and dollar signs! We incorporated fun gifs as the first landing page. All you have to do is click 'Hangry' and it will lead to your closest restaurants based on your geo-location.
